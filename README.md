# Polkadot Auctions Rewards  

## Google Sheet to check rewards, compare and analyse future price action  

### Polkadot Auction Rewards Analysis

- This sheet is to review the rewards of Polkadot Auctions. The results depend on plenty of variables that you can select.
- To interact with it, you can copy it and add API connector to update prices.
- Things written in red mean they are not confirmed by the projects / information missing.
- To only check on what rewards project offer, refer to the slide "Projects Rewards, Vesting & Distribution". I'll update it as soon as more information is available.   

### Things to see:

- Break-even MC: This breakeven is based on Selection of Columns C &
- Benefit & ROI: This is based on C & I & L
- DONNIE RATIO: What % of a project does 1,000,000 U$D give you

### Variables to Changes:

- Column C: "% Dot Locked" will strongly influence rewards as we still don't have a CAP for most projects. You can change that variable accordingly. I Selected 2% of DOT supply - as it was the average for KSM projects.
- Column I: "Selected MarketCap" can be changed to Supply "at Launch", "at 6 months", "at eand of lease".
- Column M: "Predicted MarketCap" Select this to calculate Benefit & ROI against Staking dot for that period.
- Column L: "DOT to LOCK" Select the amount of DOT you are locking.
- In slide "Projects Rewards, Vesting & Distribution" You can also select what bonuses you get (referral, early birds, etc). I selected the max possible, but you can select the other combinations.
- In slide "API Connector instructions:" you can add an API to coingecko to update prices.

### Personal Take:

- Certain Projects have great rewards (Litentry) but they have a token listed which might hinder returns.
- Certain projects have pretty low rewards, but they have good fundamentals and a very low initial supply + high initial token unvested, which gives them a good initial bump Moonbeam).
- Some projects have a bit of everything, but are really dependent on what initial Supply will be (Astar).
- Some projects have acceptable rewards, great initial hype and strong fundamentals which might be enough (Acala).
- All in all, DYOR and play with the sheet.
